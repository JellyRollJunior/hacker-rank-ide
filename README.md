# hacker-rank-ide
Tracking my progress on HackerRank :)

## Process:
 - Produce my own solution
 - Find optimal solution
 - Understand optimal solution 

## Reflection

 - MatchingStrings: focus on data structures available rather than only using lists.
   - Tip: when doing Q queries on an input, try to use preprocessing
 - LonelyInteger: focus more on mathematical theory rather than relying on prebuilt list functions
 - DiagonalDifference: need to ask myself how I can use mathematical principles (such as the commutative property of +/- to shorten code)
 - Pangrams: pay attention to conditionals as they can make the question easier!

#### not much to say section
 - FlippingBits: my first time trying bitwise operators! feels very rewarding :)
 - CountingSort: kind of a boring problem. 
   - Possible improvements: use int array to index then convert to list may be slightly faster (?)
 - TwoArrays: learned how to use comparators. First question I solved myself that I really had to think about algorithmically!. Proud! :)
