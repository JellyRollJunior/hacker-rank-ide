# hacker-rank-ide
Tracking my progress on HackerRank :)

## Process:
 - Produce my own solution
 - Find optimal solution
 - Understand optimal solution 

## Reflection

#### Basic
 - SparseArrays: focus on data structures available rather than only using lists.
   - Tip: when doing Q queries on an input, try to use preprocessing
 - LonelyInteger: focus more on mathematical theory rather than relying on prebuilt list functions
 - DiagonalDifference: need to ask myself how I can use mathematical principles (such as the commutative property of +/- to shorten code)
 - Pangrams: pay attention to conditionals as they can make the question easier!
 - SubArrayDivision1: Think about how work from previous iterations can be reused!
 - ZigZagSequence: I need to practice dealing with indices. This easy debug problem took me longer than it should have. 

#### Medium
 - FlippingTheMatrix: 
   - I won't say completed myself because I was stuck for a long time and looked at a hint that said there are only four values possible for each M[row][col] using row/col flipping. I feel slightly discouraged as previously I was at least able to hack a naive solution before looking to the discussions for help. I won't let this stop my learning though as this is what learning is all about :) if they were all easy then they wouldn't be problems. At least I can say I've successfully coded my first medium solution!
   - Tips: Have some scratch paper nearby for those tricky questions. Working this out on paper first would really have helped a lot in my opinion.

#### not much to say section
 - FlippingBits: my first time solving a solution using bitwise operators! feels very rewarding :)
 - CountingSort: kind of a boring problem. 
   - Possible improvements: use int array to index then convert to list may be slightly faster (?)
 - TwoArrays: learned how to use comparators. First question I solved myself that I really had to think about algorithmically!. Proud! :)
 - XorStrings2: debugging code, a bit too easy tbh
 - FindTheMedian: careful not to get tripped up by forgetting basics of indexing :)
 - SalesByMatchin: my first problem solved using a hashmap! Feels good using what I've learned! :)))))))
